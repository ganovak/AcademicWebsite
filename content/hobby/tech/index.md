My technical theater experience began in high school where I was a constant fixture in the school theater department learning lighting, sound, design, construction, and leadership skills while fulfilling roles from stagehand to fly crew and catwalk safety manager  and lighting board operator to production stage manager.

In college, I continued to pursue this interest both in my employment and choice of extracurricular activities. My first semester, I was hired as an Event Support Basic Technician (for more details on this position, please see Experience Tab). My accomplishment and dedication to this position did not go unnoticed and that Spring, I was promoted to the Senior Technician with a specialization in lighting. In this role, additional reponsibilities included shift leadership and lighting designing for higher profile performances. I had the opportunity to work with the University's ICCA-ranked A Cappella groups -- the Midnight Ramblers, Vocal Point, and the YellowJackets -- as well as many other student groups and faculty and community lecturers and performers.

As for the extracurricular side of things, within a week of arriving on campus, I auditioned for and subsequently joined the Opposite of People Theater Company (TOOP) as a lighting and set designer. That semester I acted as set designer for a production of Conor McPherson's *The Weir*. As a member of the production team, I collaborated with the director to recognize her vision, proposed a set design using a 3D model developed in SketchUp, and directed work crews to construct, paint, and dress the approved design. I succeeded in creating the set using only materials the company had in storage, reallocating my budget to other designers.

In December, I was elected Technical Director of TOOP. In this executive board position, I was responsible for technical aspects of productions including: providing advice and guidance to designers working on TOOP productions; organizing and directing work calls, load ins, and strikes; facilitating communication between members of the production team; managing company storage; advancing club improvement projects; and implementing the company's technical apprenticeship program in collaboration with the Production Stage Manager.
