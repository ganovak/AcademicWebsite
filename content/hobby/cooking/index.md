I have loved cooking since I finally reached the height where, step-stool assisted, I
could help my mom in the kitchen. She, likely, was less pleased as my early culinary experiments were questionable at best. I shall illustrate this with the presentation of the recipe that, no matter how many others I do master, I never seem to be able to live down. I encourage you to try it at home in your free time. Strong reactions from neighbors, guests, and intruders guaranteed. 

### Coffee Cake
Combine flour and pasteurized lemon juice in somewhat mathematically justifiable equal proportions to your hearts content. Stir until you've attained the highly prized “gloop” consistency. Microwave until hard enough to cause a mild concussion. If there is no risk of dental damage, its under cooked!

Luckily, I would improve significantly in the interceding years before, at age eleven, I became primarily responsible for preparing meals for my family.I am a self-taught cook, learning from other home cooks, YouTube, and the cookbooks at the public library. I love taking inspiration from other recipes and adapting them to my tastes or what I have on hand. I am particularly interested in using common ingredients to create new and interesting flavor profiles as well as entire dishes. I am known to read several recipes and take inspiration from all of them, combining elements into an entirely new dish. My collection of self-developed recipes grew and soon it became clear that some organizational system was necessary. These days, the family cookbook is a 600 page behemoth comprised of two volumes and containing hundreds of recipes for the dishes I cook most often. To this day, few things are more exciting than a trip to an international grocery store or spice shop. I am always on the look out for new techniques, dishes, flavors, and ingredients to add to my monster of a repertoire.
