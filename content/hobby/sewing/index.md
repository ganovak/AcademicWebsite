Although I learned to sew as a child, it was not until adulthood that I realized the potential for sewing to be a creative pursuit for me. It allows me to keep my hands busy, continually learn new skills, and produce outfits that fit my measurements and tastes exactly. I delved into clothing design and pattern drafting taking inspiration from historical fashion but centering functionality and comfort in my daily life. Recently completed projects (photos below) include a jumper dress from a hand-drafted pattern taking cues from Victorian walking skirts, a split skirt (the Victorian answer to requiring bifurcated garment for recreation, primarily cycling, that could still masquerade as a skirt in polite company), an entirely hand sewn 18th century men's shirt, and a pair of Regency area short stays (a predecessor to much more recognizable corset).
