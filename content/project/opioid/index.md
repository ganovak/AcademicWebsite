# General Project

A collaboration between Tufts University and the University of Texas, this project aims to employ geospatial analysis to examine spatio-temporal trends in opioid-related deaths. The ultimate goal is the fitting of a predictive model with the capacity to suggest areas for targeted intervention in the future.

# My involvement

- Data processing including:
  - Overcoming changes in data format to unify 18 years of vital statistics data into a single, individual data set including several covariates of interest
  - Data cleaning necessitated by errors in manual entry of death certificate information
  - Creation of a data set of death counts aggregated over month and zip code
- Exploratory data analysis, including summary tables, graphics, and maps, in collaboration with other researchers
