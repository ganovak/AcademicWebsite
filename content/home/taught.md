  Statistics Advanced teaches statistical methodology through the lens of our computation-heavy, data-driven world. Students engage in analysis employing data science (using the R programming language) and traditional statistical skills in tandem. With a particular emphasis on written and oral presentation of technical content, students explore the intersection between rigorous statistical theory, real-life application, and technology-supported analysis.

  Through this course, students will learn about computer organization, hardware and software, file management, and computational thinking â€“ the basis of computer science.  Students will learn to break down, analyze and develop logic-based solutions to complex problems, to recognize patterns, create computational artifacts, and use algorithms and flowcharts in the development of computer applications.  Subsequent technology courses will further develop skills taught in Principles of Technology and Design.
  
  
  Principles of Technology and Design introduces students to the principles of computational thinking and algorithmic design as they continue to build technical competence and problem solving skills. With an emphasis on the power and limitations of computing, students learn to decompose and reformulate problems to develop logic-based, computationally executable solutions which are implemented in Python.
