  The first few years of teaching in an independent school can be challenging. The SAIS Institute for New Teachers provides guidance, support, and the opportunity to practice planning and instructional skills with a small peer group led by an experienced independent school educator. Immediate, constructive feedback on demonstration lessons allows attendees to practice their craft in a supportive setting. This 3-day program offers practical hands-on strategies and information unique to the culture and setting of an independent school. New teachers leave this workshop empowered to create and facilitate inspired learning experiences, partner with parents, and find their place in the school community."""
