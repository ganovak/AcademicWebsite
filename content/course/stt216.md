# General Project

Using data from the Cameron County Hispanic Cohort (CCHC), this project aims to identify areas of high diabetes prevalence in order to better target interventions in an under-served population with extreme health disparities and high exposure to risk factors for chronic disease and other adverse health outcomes.

# My involvement

- Contributed to a manuscript principally describing the prevalence estimates and their methods of calculation by:
  - Calculating raw and weighted prevalences
  - Mapping prevalence estimates and plotting additional illustrative figures and tables
  - Implementing [Dr. Cici Bauer's](https://cicibauer.netlify.com/) method of Bayesian spatial modeling using the INLA package for R
  - Cleaning cohort data in collaboration with other researchers
- Managing research group collaboration through GitHub
