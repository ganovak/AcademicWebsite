The environment that best supports both studentsâ€™ learning and well-being builds up their confidence in their abilities and agency. Each student should be nurtured, met where they are at, and their individual accomplishments celebrated by both authority figures and peers. The goal is for students to gain confidence not only in the material, but in their ability to apply and extend their knowledge, to problem solve, and to learn the skills they will need throughout their lives.
